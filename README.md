**`Aspiring Developer + Musician`**

I'm a CS student and musician yet trying to figure out my path. I'm passionate about low-level learning, OS development, and cross-plattaform app development. I'd also like to create useful digital resources for other aspiring musicians.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 The weird story</h3></summary>
   When I started CS I barely even knew what it was about. I had no prior experience with programming and I wasn't a very "technical" user either. On my first semester, as time went by, I started thinking that this wasn't what I wanted to do, and I was on the verge of droping out to become a Professional Musician.
   Fortunately something clicked, figuring out what I actually wanted: I want to be everything. I've always been the type who does "way too many things". Through my whole life I've balanced being a Top Student, Conservatory Musician, Martial Artist, and many other hobbies. I figured that, if I work hard enough, I'll be able to keep up with all of them while becoming a professional in this field.
   I'm still very new to this, and I don't yet know enough to build amazing projects all by myself. But yet I would like to prove that the catchphrase ~"Jack of all trades - master of none"~ doesn't have to be true. I'll keep trying to excel at everything I do, and inspire others to try the same. -->
